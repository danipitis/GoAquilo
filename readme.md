GoAquilo
========

Current Version is 1.1.0
------------------------

**GoAquilo** is an arcade shooting game, similar with space wars/chicken invaders but simpler. You are a solider with a gun and your goal is to take down as many enemies as you a can before they "escape" from the screen. 

   - Use left and right arrow keys to move, mouse or space to shoot
   - Try to shoot as many terrorists as you can
   - Be *quick*
   - Try to reach Level 6
   - Take the source code and add your ideas to it

I started working on this game after taking the online <a href="http://programarcadegames.com" target="_blank">class</a> from **Paul Vincent Craven**. If you want to start making arcade games using python i definitely advice you to go on the website and start learning. It's *AWESOME* !

Technologies used
-----------------

GoAquilo is coded using **Python 2.7.3** and the **Pygame 1.9.2a0** modules
